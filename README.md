Online Learning Platform
This repository contains the code for a simple Online Learning Platform designed to provide a user-friendly interface for students to access educational resources such as video lessons, quizzes, and certificates. The platform is developed using HTML and CSS and is structured to include multiple pages, which are linked to provide a seamless learning experience.

Features
Navigation Menu:

The navigation bar is present at the top of each page and includes essential links to important sections of the platform:
Dashboard: For the user to track their progress and navigate to different courses or resources.
Lessons: A section dedicated to video lessons, where students can learn course material.
Quiz: This section allows students to take quizzes related to the lessons they have completed.
Certificate: After completing a course, users can access their certificates.
Logout: A logout link is provided for users to exit their accounts when finished.
Hero Section:

The home page features a hero section with a welcoming heading, an introductory message, and a prominent Get Started button that redirects users to the login page. This section is designed to make the platform inviting and to encourage users to begin their learning journey.
Responsive Design:

The platform is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens. The CSS styles include media queries to adjust the layout based on the screen size, ensuring that the platform remains usable and visually appealing on different devices.
About, Courses, and Contact Sections:

The platform features navigation links to an About section that describes the platform, a Courses section with information about available courses, and a Contact section where users can find ways to get in touch with the platform administrators for support or inquiries.
Footer:

The footer of the website contains copyright information, which indicates the rights reserved for the platform and adds a professional touch to the overall design.
Technology Stack
HTML: The structure of the platform is built with HTML, using semantic elements that help with accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
CSS: Styling is applied through an external CSS file linked in the <head> section of the HTML document. The CSS file controls the platform's visual appearance, including its layout, typography, color scheme, and responsive design.

Usage
This platform serves as a foundational step toward creating a full-fledged e-learning website. The current implementation provides basic functionality for students to browse through lessons, take quizzes, and view certificates. As the project evolves, additional features such as quizzes with dynamic scoring, a user login system, and a back-end database could be integrated to enhance the platform's capabilities.

Future Enhancements
User Authentication: Adding a login and registration system to allow users to create accounts and track their progress.
Database Integration: Incorporating a back-end database (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB) to store user data, quiz scores, and certificates.
Interactive Quizzes: Expanding the quiz functionality to include scoring, feedback, and a more interactive learning experience.
Video Player: Integrating a more advanced video player for a richer learning experience.
